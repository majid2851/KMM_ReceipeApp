Kotlin Mutlti-Platform (KMM)

For Designing of Cross-platform apks there are different ways and languages like flutter,reactNative,...
but it seems for a kotlin developer there is another way . Kotlin multi-platform
there are benefits in using kmm . the main benefit is that we don't need to learn another reactNative,flutter for that porpuse.
and the weakness is for ios apk you have to have mac in order to design Ui by swift ui.
by the way most programmers believe using flutter is the best choice but I think as a kotlin developer , we should learn kmm.
